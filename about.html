            <h1>About<br> Me</h1>
            <p>My journey didn’t start in a computer science classroom—it began in CAD drafting, design, and technical problem-solving, where I learned how to transform abstract ideas into tangible results. Over time, I realized my true passion lies in building digital experiences that are as functional as they are beautiful.<br>With a background in graphic design, CAD, and technical data management, I bring a unique blend of creative eye, structured workflow, and detail obsession to front-end development. I thrive on creating user-focused solutions—whether it’s organizing complex layouts, optimizing performance, or making an interface feel right.<br> I’m fluent in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with growing expertise in modern frameworks like React. My experience managing projects, solving technical challenges, and collaborating across teams makes me an asset in fast-moving environments. I don’t just code—I translate complexity into clarity.
